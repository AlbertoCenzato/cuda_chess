# CUDA CHESS
This is a free-time, long-term project. Its objective is to put together some skills 
acquired during the computer science courses I attended in the last years. 
The final outcome should be a chess game able to interact with the player 
"seeing" the pieces on a real world chessboard and to decide what the next move should be. 

The main effort will be focused on the developement of a module for the game AI 
and a computer vision module for the chessboard perception. 
For the game AI I will try to implement a simple recursive algorithm 
and some more advanced supervised learning and reinforcement learning techniques. 
All the implementation should be cross-platform and take advantage of the speedups 
delivered by a CUDA-capable hardware and/or a multithreaded environment where avaliable.
